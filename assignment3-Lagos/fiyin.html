			<p> I am <strong> Fiyinfoluwa Oluyinka </strong>(born November 29, 1995) in Lagos Nigeria. I am from a family of six consisting of my parents, my 3 siblings, and myself. I began boarding school (at Loyola Jesuit College Abuja) at the age of 10, and six years later, upon my graduation, I moved to India, where I attended the Mahindra United World College. It was during my time at UWC, with friends from over 80 different countries, I learned to appreciate people's cultures, opinions and beliefs. It was also at UWC that I got my first taste into the world of Engineering. I worked with my tema members on a go-kart project. My experiences, coupled with my passion for electronics prompted me to apply to the University of Rochester, to pursue a bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. </p>

			<p>  I am  a strong research professional pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Rochester. Over the years, I have developed strong analytical skills from tackling various projects ranging from circuit analysis and design, to probability and statistics. I am very interested in Financial Technology, Electronics Hardware Design, Power, and pretty much any opportunity for me to use technology as a tool to improve business performances, mitigate risk, and provide innovative solutions to meet project demands</p>

			<h3> Xerox Engineering Research Fellowship </h3>
			</section>

			<p>In the summer of my Junior year, I worked as a research fellow in the University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics as a part of the Xerox Engineering Fellows Program. I assisted Dr. Roman Sobolewski and his team with their research on terahertz photonics and nano device characterization. Over the course of the fellowship, I performed experiments to explore the interaction between carbon nanotube samples and lasers within the Terahertz frequency range and I really enjoyed it. With the data obtained from these experiments, I calculated necessary parameters such as the conductivity, absorption coefficient and permittivity of the samples using MATLAB. However, considering the relatively short (8 weeks) duration of the program, I was only able to reach a preliminary conclusion. This prompted me to sign up for the Semiconductor Devices advanced elective, and to begin my Independent study in terahertz photonics in the fall semester of my senior year, in order for me to further develop my research and analytical skills, and to assist the team in fully understanding our samples, and discovering potential ground-breaking applications for them in industries ranging from security to medicine. </p>

			<h3> KPMG </h3>
			</section>

			<p>In my sophomore year, I had the opportunity to intern in the Technology Advisory unit of KPMG Nigeria, where I worked as a member of the project implementation team managing Fidelity Bank Nigeria’s core banking platform upgrade. On this engagement, I tracked issues experienced by the bank staff nationwide during simulations of the new platform, and collaborated with the bank’s technical team to ensure the issues were resolved within the required timeframe. I also prepared project assessment reports, for the project team as well as the Bank's Executive board, to keep them up to speed with the project’s progress. Overall, I learned how to work in a deadline-oriented environment, enhanced my collaborative skills, became adept in the use of Microsoft Excel as a tool for data analytics.</p>

			<h2> Extra Curricular Activities </h2>
			</section>
 			</section>

			<p> Extending beyond my academics, my time as an undergraduate student has been a wonderful learning experience. As a sprinter on the university’s track team, I understand the value of teamwork, and I have a competitive spirit which drives me to achieve my goals. I have developed very good time management skills as result of balancing practices, travelling, my academic course load, and my extracurricular activities. I also served as workshop leader for two signals and circuits classes (ECE 111 and ECE 113), and a laboratory teaching assistant for the electromagnetic waves course (ECE 230). From these experiences, I was able to further understand the concepts covered in these classes, and from interacting with the students, I developed strong interpersonal and group facilitating skills.</p>
