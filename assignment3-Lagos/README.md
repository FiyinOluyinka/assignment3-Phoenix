Fiyinfoluwa Oluyinka - Information Architect
For the purpose of this assignment, we decided to maintain our group members, and to write about each of us.

Essentially the webpage would cover three students from the African Continent

Fiyinfoluwa Oluyinka from Nigeria, Olatunde Oshunlaja from Nigeria, and Propser Feya from Zimbabwe

Over the course of the webpage we highlight some similarities in their backgrounds, their hobbbies, as well as courses taken at the University. At the university, Prosper and Fiyin are Electrical and Computer Engineering Majors, while Olatunde is a Business major, with a minor in Computer Science. 

As the Information Architech, I ensured that the students indeed had a common theme; Their African Descent, and I was able to gather relevant information such as their brief intros, work experiences, and hobbies. The content of the website was appropriately classidied into 3 main sections; An About Me section (giving a one paragraph description of the student), Work Experience, and lastly their hobbies.

In order to prevent a long scrolly webpage, a grid layout was suggested. As can be seen in the comments on the Index html file, I suggested google font; Scholtz Fonts for the Headings because the fonts contains prints in its structure quite similar to traditional african patterns, hence it would go well with the overall theme of the website being African.

I also selected the right images for the website. On the index page, 5 pictures were chosen, as they are an accurate depiction of the beautiful natural aesthetics the African continent has to offer. I slider Java Script was chosen to cycle through 4 of the images. These images are Zuma rock; an inconinc natural attraction in Nigeria, the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, and 2 pictures from an African Safari. It should be noted that I chose to include the pictures from Nigeria and Zimbabwe, becasuse these are the countries in the continent where the selected students are from. For the individual pages, I was able to collect pictures of the students in their traditonal African attire, in order to further showcase their rich African Culture. I also ensured that all pictures where the same size as the other pictures in their respective categories. I.E the pictures in the slider on the home page are all similar, and the pictures on each page are similar, all with the same size specifications.

Lastly, I went with an accordion on the homepage, as this does a good job of introducing the students, whilst efficiently using the space on the webpage. I also ensured that each of the individual introductions had a link to their respective pages.

I then gave instructions to the designer to implement certain design ideas such as a the color scheme, fonts, and layout to ensure that our websage came out well



Prosper - Designer
I applied the principles of page design (the CRAP principles) by using the red and black colors which represent African colors and themes
For the page patterns I used the (Z pattern)
I made sure I used the good practices of readability that go with the list of 10 Principles Of Readability and Web Typography
I used the two custom fonts (font-family: Courier; and font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;)while applying best practices in typography with considerations of the six typographic groups: GHOTMS
