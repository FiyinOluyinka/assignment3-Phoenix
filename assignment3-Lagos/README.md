# assignment3-Phoenix

For the purpose of this assignment, we decided to maintain our group members, and to write about each of us.

Essentially the webpage would cover three students from the African Continent

Fiyinfoluwa Oluyinka from Nigeria, Olatunde Oshunlaja from Nigeria, and Propser Feya from Zimbabwe

Over the course of the webpage we highlight some similarities in their backgrounds, their hobbbies, as well as courses taken at the University. At the university, Prosper and Fiyin are Electrical and Computer Engineering Majors, while Olatunde is a Business major, with a minor in Computer Science.

I applied the principles of page design (the CRAP principles) by using the red and black colors which represent African colors and themes
For the page patterns I used the (Z pattern)
I made sure I used the good practices of readability that go with the list of 10 Principles Of Readability and Web Typography
I used the two custom fonts (font-family: Courier; and font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;)while applying best practices in typography with considerations of the six typographic groups: GHOTMS
